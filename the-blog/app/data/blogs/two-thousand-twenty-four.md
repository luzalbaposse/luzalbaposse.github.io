As every year, I start by saying that I love doing recaps. This year brought so many amazing experiences, along with a few not-so-great ones. Here are my lessons from my first year in my 20s.

I realized that I can't do everything, once again.
- That sometimes we're more vulnerable than we think.
- That it's beautiful to hold the hand of those you love.
- That laughing is good for you, and you should do it often.
- That it's important to hug your family.
- That sometimes your family is bigger than it seems—you choose new members every day.
- That life is about taking risks.
- That playing games has so much value.
- That sometimes we have to accept our priorities—it's not always obvious what we want to do.
- That it's okay to choose your own path, even if you don't have references for it.
- That exercising helps me stay focused.
- That sleeping 8 hours per day is not overrated.
- That I'm deeply passionate about my work, and I'm in an incredible moment in my career.
- That I love building things just as much as I love solving problems.
- That sometimes people believe in you more than you believe in yourself, and it's okay to trust that—it can lead you to incredible places.
- That a grade doesn't define you; it's not what matters.
- That sometimes you need to feel a little "failed."
- That you don't have to compare yourself to others because you have your own path.
- That it's good to listen to those around you.
- That it's vital to find good mentors and that I've chosen really good ones—you know who you are, kisses and hugs!
- That our perspective isn't always the "real" one.
- That my friends are bulletproof.
- That reality is sometimes more neutral than it seems.
- That we are the ones who color the world.
- That making a small bad decision really isn't the end of the world.
- That it's not good to punish ourselves. Things happen, but what matters is how we respond to those situations.
- That things sometimes go wrong, more frequently than you might expect.
- That we need to embrace our ego and learn when to let it go.
- That dealing with being wrong is hard but necessary.
- That getting on a plane to another continent can be dizzying.
- That some people feel like they've always been there.
- That we're freer when we worry less about yesterday and tomorrow.
- That we are living in interesting times.

I understood that we are human and being human is extremely exciting.
