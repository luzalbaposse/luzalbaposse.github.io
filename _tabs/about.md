## Bio, or something like that

Hello! I'm Lu, a dedicated Bachelor in Digital Technology student and an advocate for harnessing technology to drive positive social change. As a Teaching Assistant & Research Assistant at Torcuato Di Tella University, I dive deep into the realms of blockchain technology, imparting knowledge on DeFi, Smart Contracts, and governance, while also exploring the intersection of political polarization and human behavior in the Neuroscience Laboratory.

My journey in tech has seen me embrace roles that marry design with utility, particularly in service of those with disabilities. As a UX/UI Designer with Asteroid Technologies, I contributed to the evolution of Háblalo, a tool designed to empower individuals with communication challenges, enhancing their interaction with the world around them.

I'm an active volunteer, offering my time to organizations like DiTella Blockchain Club and participating in programs aimed at elevating women in technology. My passion for development has also led me to co-found initiatives that champion human rights and democratize access to information :) (learn more about that in esixellas.com)

My design sensibilities are matched by my technical acumen, having developed projects like Morvo, which uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect journalistic integrity, and Las Que Deciden, a data visualization platform that brings to light the underrepresented political voices of Latin American women.

As someone who has seen firsthand the transformational power of technology, I am driven by the conviction that it is a powerful tool in the struggle for inclusion and the improvement of life quality for many.

> Excited about blockchain, game theory, math, politics and human behivour :)
